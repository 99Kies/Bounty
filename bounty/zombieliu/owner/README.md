About
The Academy Vision ...


Bankless Academy was established by a core of passionate individuals with the vision of onboarding one-billion people to the Ethereum and Web3 ecosystems. We aim to become one of the ecosystem’s flagship “knowledge on-ramps” for the mass adoption of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance.



At the Academy, Users will learn about topics such as blockchain infrastructure, decentralized finance, NFT technology, and how to navigate the Web3 multiverse in a safe and secure way. Our Education Protocol aims to serve as the greater Web3 community as the open-source Public Good that guides students’ transformation from total rookie to becoming Bankless!

Such a transformation will be achieved primarily through the Academy’s fine-tuned lesson format that integrates essential reading with graphic and video elements to build the learner’s foundational understanding of advanced concepts.



Building Bankless Academy ...


With the touchstone goal of onboarding one-billion people to Web3, the genesis team set to work on defining the protocol’s approach to written content and visual style, to bring a personality to the brand that would act as the warm and openly extended hand that new users seek in this space. Meanwhile, our builders began building the core protocol framework that would become the first iteration of the Academy platform. 

We celebrated our initial launch in February 2022, with onboarding events taking place at ETHDenver.



In the weeks following public launch, Bankless Academy has been refining its operations:



    • Art and Branding has synthesised the protocol’s meta-narrative that firmly aligns with the BanklessDAO mission, vision, and values. This narrative has begun to shine through our original artwork, helping to immerse Web3 explorers in their journey through the realm of decentralised blockchain tooling and Bankless mastery!

    • Product Design has been consistently optimizing the platform, resulting in the sleek and stylish web interface online today. We are proud of how responsive, intuitive, and easy to use our platform has become.

    • Content has pulled together the knowledge of countless contributors, laying the groundwork for soon-to-be-released lessons that move beyond the protocol’s “User Initialization” stage and propel them into increasingly involved topics!

    • And Project Management has been selectively tracking and scaling the team to provide the most optimized funding runway possible for achieving the project mission.



Alongside these fixed departments, a larger pool of freelance contributors worked to launch Bankless Academy. These contributors have been paid out in bounties, and in some cases where the actual workload was more than the projected workload, some departments have foregone their own wages to assure team contributors get paid first. 



Building Bankless Academy has been a testament to the shared vision, values and desire for community building that are driving people to adopt cryptocurrencies today.



Walkthrough of the Academy’s ‘Minimum Viable Product’ ...


Below is a quick tour of the recently launched ‘Bankless Academy MVP-II’ interface.



Each course contains key information such as learning objectives and goals, knowledge gates, as well as closing with an interactive task that tests what users have learned. In the current iteration a POAP is awarded as proof-of-knowledge, though the team has plans to build its own proprietary badge system. Estimated completion time is included to let students know the commitment required, and a completion counter is visible to show its current popularity.
